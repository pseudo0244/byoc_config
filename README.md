# 3D Configurator for BYOC (Build Your Own Car)

This project is a 3D configurator that allows users to build and customize their own cars interactively. It is developed using **Three.js** for 3D rendering and **Vite** for fast development and bundling. The configurator enables users to select and modify different car parts, colors, and accessories in real-time, offering an engaging and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Car Model**: Users can view and manipulate the 3D model of their car in real-time.
- **Customization Options**: The configurator allows for the customization of various colors, and accessories.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Powered by Three.js for smooth and high-quality 3D rendering.
- **Fast Development and Build**: Uses Vite for a fast and efficient development workflow and bundling process.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes bundled with Node.js)

## Running the Project
